# Contributing to Resource Management by Smartsheet API User Guide

## Purpose

This guide explains how to contribute to the Resource Management by Smartsheet User Guide. The actual Resource Management by Smartsheet API documentation can be viewed [here](https://10kft.github.io/10kft-api/).

## Submitting Changes
The project should be tested locally before putting up a pull request to ensure that the changes are working as expected and original functionality is not affected.

### Testing Changes
Follow the steps in the [README.md](README.md#Running-the-Docs-Locally) to run the documentation page locally. Ensure that the original functionality of the page is intact and the new changes are behaving as expected.

### Putting up a Pull Request
After testing the proposed changes, please fork a branch and then submit a pull request. [More info about pull requests here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)

Contributors do not have access to push directly to the `master` branch, so all code changes will be made through approved pull requests.

## Publishing
If you would like to publish changes to the documentation files once your pull request has been approved, see [Publishing](PUBLISHING.md).
