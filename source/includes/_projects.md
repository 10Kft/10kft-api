# Projects

##### Endpoint: `/api/v1/projects`

Project is a subclass of Assignable. You will see the `id` referring to a project as `assignable_id` in other models. Sub-projects are called phases and share the same data model. A Phase has a `parent_id` that is not `null`. A project or phase can be deleted by setting the optional `archived` parameter to `true`, it can also be unarchived by setting `archived` to `false`.

Projects where `archived` is set to `true` cannot be updated. You must first unarchive (set `archived` to `false`) before updating the project.

## Project State

`project_state` describes the state of the project:

- Confirmed
- Tentative
- Internal

## Show a project

```
GET  /api/v1/projects/<project_id>
```

## Show a project with its phases

```
GET  /api/v1/projects/<project_id>?fields=children
```

## Create a project
Note: You cannot add thumbnails to the project through the API

```
POST  /api/v1/projects

{
"name": "My Project",
"starts_at": "2015-03-01",
"ends_at": "2015-06-01"
}
```

## Update a Project
Note: You cannot add thumbnails to the project through the API

```
PUT  /api/v1/projects/1245

{
  "id": 1245,
  "name": "New Project Name",
  "ends_at": "2015-05-31"
}
```

## Locking Time Entries

`timeentry_lockout` is used to control when new time entries are no longer accepted to a project.

| **Value** | **Description** |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| -1 | Not locked |
| 0 | Locked |
| 7 | Locked for entries more than 7 calendar days ago. This can be any positive integer value |

Note that positive integer values in this attribute are numbers of days relative to today's date on the calendar. We do not support setting this lockout value to a specific date.

If your project has phases, note that this must also be set for each phase assignable_id for it to take effect as intended.
