# Approvals

##### Endpoint: `/api/v1/approvals`

In 10,000ft, certain record types are considered "approvable." Currently, these record types are time entries and expense items. Approvals are created when time entries or expense items are "submitted for approval."


## List Approvals

```
GET /api/v1/approvals
```

While you can get approvals directly from `/api/v1/approvals`, a more typical scenario is to include approvals when getting time entries or expense items by specifying "approvals" as a field. One advantage of this is that you also get "unsubmitted" records that do not yet have an associated approval record.

Example

```
GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>/time_entries

# note "fields=approvals"
curl 'https://vnext.10000ft.com/api/v1/users/1/time_entries?fields=approvals&auth=..'
```

Response

```json
{
  "paging": {
    ...
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "user_id": 1,
      "hours": 8,
      "scheduled_hours": null,
      ...
      "approvals": {
        "paging": {
          ...
        },
        "data": [
          {
            "id": 789,
            "status": "pending",
            "approvable_id": 123,
            "approvable_type": "TimeEntry",
            "submitted_by": 1,
            "submitted_at": "2016-10-13T01:52:09Z",
            "approved_by": null,
            "approved_at": null,
            "created_at": "2016-10-13T01:52:09Z",
            "updated_at": "2016-10-13T01:52:09Z"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

If you do get approvals from `/api/v1/approvals`, you can similarly specify "approvables" as a field.

## Submitting and Approving Approvables

```
POST /api/v1/approvals
```

Approvals are not created or updated directly. Rather, approvable records are submitted or approved through a POST request to `/api/v1/approvals`. **Note that only administrators and project managers can approve time and expenses, which means that API users can only submit time and expenses, but not approve.**


##### Required parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| approvables | an array of approvable objects |
| status | either "pending" (submitting for approval) or "approved" (approving) |

##### Approvable object:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| id | the id of the time entry or expense item |
| type | either "TimeEntry" or "ExpenseItem" |
| updated_at | the "updated_at" time stamp of the time entry or expense item |

`updated_at` is required to ensure that the time entry or expense item has not changed since the submitter or approver has viewed it. For example, if an approver views a time entry of 4 hours and intends to approve that time, but meanwhile someone else updates the time entry to be 5 hours instead of 4, the approver might unintentionally approve a 5 hour time entry while believing they are approving a 4 hour time entry. For this reason, approvals will only be created or updated for approvables that have the correct `updated_at` value.

Example

```shell
POST /api/v1/approvals

# request body
{
  "approvables": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "type":"TimeEntry",
      "updated_at": "2016-10-04T15:33:32Z"
    }
  ],
  "status": "pending"
}
```

Response

```
{
  "paging": {
    ...
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 890,
      "status": "pending",
      "approvable_id": 123,
      "approvable_type": "TimeEntry",
      "submitted_by": 8,
      "submitted_at": "2016-10-13T20:16:40Z",
      "approved_by": null,
      "approved_at": null,
      "created_at": "2016-10-13T20:16:40Z",
      "updated_at": "2016-10-13T20:16:40Z"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Deleting Approvals

```
DELETE /api/v1/approvals/<approval_id>
```

Approvals can only be deleted if the status is "pending".
