# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">10,000ft API (Pro, Enterprise, and Business plans)</span>

<aside class="notice">Last updated: 02/05/2019</aside>

The 10,000ft API provides programmatic access to projects, users and time entries in your account, commonly referred to as _resources_ in the rest of this API documentation. The API implements a standard HTTP REST pattern and allows callers with appropriate authentication and authorization to programmatically create, read, update and delete these resources.

API access is available on Pro, Enterprise and Business plans of 10000ft. As of June 2019, all new plans purchased are Business, and include API access. For customers prior to this date, API access is based on your current plan.

<%# # Case studies

Some case studies of our customers using our API to build new tools and applications using the 10Kft API.

  * [Fancy Pants Group](https://www.10000ft.com/blog/fancy-pants-group-case-study), a digital creative studio based in New York, recently used our API to develop and launch a custom project importer cheekily called Job the Builder. Their goal is to make it easy for everyone on their 100-person team to see and communicate consistent data across multiple tools. %>

# Third party libraries

A few of our customers have implemented and shared API client libraries to help using the 10Kft API easier. Depending on your scenario, you may benefit from adopting and improving on them. Here are a couple of references,
