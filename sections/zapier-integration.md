Once the connection is setup and tested, you can use it to make new Zap. Lets go through the steps and setup an example Zap.

## Configuring a Zap

Configuring a 10,000ft Zap typically involves,

* Connecting your 10,000ft account with Zapier
* Selecting a 10,000ft trigger
* Optionally, configure one or more Search steps to look up additional details
  * 10,000ft Triggers typically return user or assignable IDs
  * We provide find actions so you can get additional details (e.g. a user's email address) given their ID
  * This allows you to combine attributes you get from the trigger with additional attributes you get via searching to create Zaps that are rich in details and provide higher value.
* Choosing an app to connect with (e.g. Email)
* Configure, test and enable your Zap

## Example: Send an email when a new assignment is made in 10,000ft

Lets try a specific example. In the steps below we will make a Zap that will send an email to when one of your team members are assigned to a project. When you are done, this is what the outline of your Zap will look like,

And here are the steps in detail,

* Sign in to your Zapier account
* Start a Zap
* Search for the 10,000ft app and select it
* Select a 10,000ft Trigger (e.g. New Assignment)
  
  <img src="../assets/make-a-zap/1.png" alt="new assignment trigger" width="480">

* Connect your 10,000ft app if prompted by supplying your 10,000ft API token
* Add a step to search 10,000ft and lookup details for the user_id in the assignment
  
  <img src="../assets/make-a-zap/6.png" alt="find user by id options" width="480">

  * Add a step and select 10,000ft as the app
  * Search and select the `Find User by ID` action
  * Configure it to find the user for the `user_id` from the New Assignment trigger we setup above
  
* Add a step to search 10,000ft and lookup details for the assignable_id in the assignment
  * Add a step and select 10,000ft as the app
  * Search and select the `Find Assignable by ID` action
  * Configure it to find the assignable for the `assignable_id` from the New Assignment trigger we setup above
* Add a step to send an email
  
  <img src="../assets/make-a-zap/email-template-options.png" alt="email template options" width="480">

  * Select the Email by Zapier app
  * Configure it to send an email to user in the New Assignment
  * When you are done, the email template will look like this,
  
* Test and enable your Zap.

Now, when a new assignment is made on the 10,000ft schedule, the person who was assigned will be sent an email with the name of the Project (or Leave) that they were assigned to and the start date of that assignment.

## Filters & additional considerations

Zapier Filters are useful when building integrations with 10,000ft. You can use any attribute from a trigger of search action when implementing a filter. The `Type` attribute available in 10,000ft users and assignabled are particularly useful. For example, in the example above your Zap would typically exclude Placeholder users. This would be implemented by adding a FIlter to you Zap as shown below.

Familiarize yourself with the different types of users and assignables available in 10,000ft when designing your 10,000ft Zaps so you can get the result you are trying to achive with your integration. See [10,000ft API documentation](../README.md) for more details on specific attributes.
