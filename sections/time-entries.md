# Time Entries

Time Entries are a collection of hours tracked per project and user. There are two main kinds of time_entries.

## Suggested time entries

Suggested time entries (also know as unconfirmed time entries) are created by 10,000ft as a result of resources being assigned to a project. These are identifiable by the `is_suggestion: true` attribute on the time entry objects. Suggested time entries are not returned by the API by default and must be requested using the `with_suggestions=true` parameter on the GET API call to fetch time entries.

Suggested time entries are read-only and are kept up to date by 10Kft as the corresponding assignments are updated.

## Confirmed time entries.

Confirmed time entries are what a user (or the API) has explicitly created to indicate that they have spent some time working on a project.

## Time Entries and Resource Only Users

Note that just like in the application UI, you cannot create new confirmed time entries for resource only users via the API. You can read suggested time entries for all users via the API.

## Bill Rates

Time entries have an associated bill rate attached to them. When a new time entry is created, 10Kft will determine the appropriate bill rate for it (based on your account and project settings) and assign a values. When reading time entries, you can see this assigned bill rate.

### Optional Query Parameters:

| **Name** | **Description** | format |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| from | get projects that start on or after this date | &from=2017-03-14 |
| to | get projects that end on or before this date | &to=2017-03-21 |
| with_suggestions | true to include suggested (unconfirmed) time entries based on assignments on the schedule | &with_suggestions=true |

> IMPORTANT: *to* and *from* _must_ be a valid date formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`

### Creating Time Entries

When creating time entries, a valid user_id, assignable_id, date and hours must be supplied. Assignable id can be `assignable_id`, `project_id` or `leave_type_id`.

You can optionally specify values for `task` and `notes`. If you know a valid `bill_rate_id` matching the user and project of the time entry, you can specify that at the time of creating a time entry as well.

```
POST /api/v1/users/<user_id>/time_entries

{
  "user_id": <user_id>,
  "assignable_id": 1001,
  "date": "2012-01-21",
  "hours": 0.5,
  "task": 'Travel',
  "notes": 'Drive to Seattle, WA to meet with 10Kft'
}
```

Note that the user_id in the URL must match the user_id in the POST data in the above example. In this example, the user_id in post data is optional. Similar rules apply when you manipulate time entries within a project time entries collection, like below

```
POST /api/v1/projects/<project_id>/time_entries

{
  "user_id": 123,
  "assignable_id": <project_id>,
  "date": "2012-01-01",
  "hours": 4.0,
}
```

## Examples

A confirmed time entry (note `is_suggestion` is false).

```
{
  "id":100001,
  "user_id": 123,
  "assignable_id": 1001,
  "assignable_type": "Project",
  "date": "2013-09-11",
  "hours": 8.0,
  "is_suggestion": false,
  "scheduled_hours": null,
  "task": null,
  "bill_rate": 150,
  "bill_rate_id": 4,
  "created_at": "2013-09-12T04:32:28Z",
  "updated_at": "2013-09-18T04:32:28Z"
}
```

A suggested time entry (note is_suggestion is true) and hours are given in `scheduled_hours` instead of `hours`. Task and notes are null in suggested time entries as well.

```
{
  "id":100000,
  "user_id": 123,
  "assignable_id": 1001,
  "assignable_type": "Project",
  "date": "2013-09-11",
  "hours": null,
  "is_suggestion": true,
  "scheduled_hours": 8.0,
  "task": null,
  "notes": null,
  "bill_rate": 150,
  "bill_rate_id": 4,
  "created_at": "2013-09-12T04:32:28Z",
  "updated_at": "2013-09-18T04:32:28Z"
}
```
