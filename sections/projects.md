# Projects

##### Endpoint: `/api/v1/projects`

Project is a subclass of Assignable. You will see the `id` referring to a project as `assignable_id` in other models. Sub-projects are called phases and share the same data model. A Phase has a `parent_id` that is not `null`. A project or phase can be deleted by setting the optional `archived` parameter to `true`, it can also be unarchived by setting `archived` to `false`.

Projects where `archived` is set to `true` cannot be updated. You must first unarchive (set `archived` to `false`) before updating the project.

## Project State

`project_state` describes the state of the project (these values are read-only via API):

| Confirmed | Tentative | Internal |

## Locking Time Entries

`timeentry_lockout` is marked as -1 when the the feature is disabled. When `timeentry_lockout` >= 0 indicates how old time entries can be before they are locked and cannot be changed.
