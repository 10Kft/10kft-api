# 10,000ft API

The 10,000ft API provides programmatic access to projects, users and time entries in your account, commonly referred to as _resources_ in the rest of this API documentation. The API implements a standard HTTP REST pattern and allows callers with appropriate authentication and authorization to programmatically create, read, update and delete these resources.
